      <description>RStudio is a formidable IDE to work with and offers an environment to seamlessly work with multiple languages beyond R. It is especially convenient for tasks involving frequent visualisation of data frames and plots, and for use with Shiny app development.
However, the text (i.e code) editing capabalities are still significantly lacking compared to the likes of Emacs and Vim. Besides this, it does not offer a seamless interface integrating task, time management and multi-language programming environments to the extent available within Org-mode via Emacs.</description>

This is an evolving summary of my exploration with Docker. It should prove to be a handy refresher of commands and concepts.

      <description>“I never made one of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking” ― Albert Einstein “To be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually thrown out of the nest. To live fully is to be always in no-man’s-land, to experience each moment as completely new and fresh. To live is to be willing to die over and over again. ” ― Pema Chödrön, When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times Perfectionism can’t survive unless it is fed with the oxygen of indulgence and paranoia and irrationality.</description>
