      <p>Whiplash is a fascinating movie on many levels regarding a topic that interests me deeply&#x2026; How to progressively perform, and strive to become the very best in a chosen field. Personally, I found each step of the movie rivetting and would recommend it to anybody who would find the above question even mildly interesting. The movie&rsquo;s climax  was immensely interesting, inspiring and supported by great acting.  At any rate, the movie induced a blog post&#x2026;</p>

<p>Whiplash is basically an insight into the mind and life of a student who wants to be among the greats in his field, and the way he deals with an abrasive, abusive and unorthodox teacher whose intentions are to bring out the best in a student. No movie is perfect - while some points in Whiplash do appear extreme and therefore relatively unrealistic - the overriding message and theme conveyed certainly rings out clearly, in an engaging plot.</p>

<p>Some interesting points of note from this movie, infused with my own thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The belief of the teacher, that the best performance or attributes hidden inside a person can come out only via multiple, unexpected and  stressful proddings.</li>
<li>the mental conditioning required to weather and beat intense, sharp, depressing criticism along with verbal and physical abuse from a mentor or teacher and use the same as a motive force for self improvement and eventually superlative performance. At an age, where there is a growing attitude of the upcoming generation thinking that they are automatically entitled to several things, things that the older generation earned through hard work - such an approach would not be tolerated by most people today. Beyond the movie, I know real stories of people working under such mentors, striving to learn and gain their approval and eventually winning the same. These efforts paid off by resulting in skills, thinking patterns and a mental conditioning  simply superior to most other peers. Finding such a mentor at the formative stage is probably the best thing to happen to anybody. The suffering will eventually be worth it. However, with such mentors - it is important to be able to judge that the mentor has the knowledge or skill that is worth all the trouble being taken.</li>
<li>Getting back up after a fall: Everybody breaks. Just as the promising student in Whiplash breaks. But the champions among us rally,  to stage a comeback and performance that makes history remember them. This characteristic is portrayed by several characters who turned out to be popular among the audience, like Rocky Balboa.</li>
<li>Regularly surpassing the level of deliberate knowledge of your own performance, and thus improvement by exactly being able to measure your performance and pinpoint mistakes. This point is portrayed in a very interesting manner in Whiplash, where the teacher expects the student to know exactly what mistake is being made.</li>
<li>Rejecting the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; or &lsquo;Good enough&rsquo; feedback from anybody. The goal is to be Great, not good. The goal should be to strive to set the precedent and not just follow a beaten track. The pinpoint focus should be on progressive improvement to become the best and that entails never being satisfied and ruthless rooting out of mistakes.</li>
<li>Great performance is about that perfect balance between the body, mind and consciousness. I view the scene where the student survives a car crash, just to reach a performance and then not being able to perform, as a good example of overreaching, without strengthening the core, and thus inviting instability. This is logically followed by the student lashing out at the teacher. At the same time, the obsessive pursual of excellence and preparation resulted in the student being able to take advantage of an opportunity to become a part of the core music group (at an earlier point)  when the opportunity presented itself. Nevertheless, the ability to take advantage of that opportunity was also a result of backbreaking hard work.</li>

<li><p>It was the ending of Whiplash that truly drove me to comprehend the points so far. It is twisted, quite unexpected and drove me to truly enjoy the movie and appreciate that despite the above points being reasonably discernible - the human mind and nature is exceedingly complex. Stability and reasoning are not the only keystones to the foundation of greatness. There has to be a <em>healthy</em> mix of crazy thrown in, to make it what it is.</p>

<p><a href="https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/unlocking-the-talent-code-with-dan-coyle" target="_blank">Unlocking the Talent Code With Dan Coyle</a> on the Unmistakable Creatives podcast provides an insight, in line with the points seen above, into what constitute outliers and performers. The interesting concept of &lsquo;Learning velocity&rsquo; is explained by Dan via an example. It is surmised that progress and maximum learning to become better occurs <em>at</em> the boundary line dividing what we know at the moment, and the unknown skills that beckon. That point sems to be an amalgamation of several things, that are typically present when someone is in &lsquo;flow&rsquo;. Perhaps this flow can be described as a heightened sense of what is, and what should be and the energy to strive and achieve what should be.. It certainly does feel logical to think that we become better by pushing that boundary. There are several facts thrown out in that podcast, and I&rsquo;d recommend that too.</p></li>
