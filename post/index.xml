      <description>Introduction Code School is kind enough to occasionally offer a free weekend with full access to their normally paid courses. I was able to capitalize on two such occasions to complete several courses. Below are the notes that were captured, directly into org-mode in emacs. The code builds on examples and lessons available on the Code School courses.
 Code School: I&amp;rsquo;ve completed courses on Python, Git, Regular Expressions and SQL.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  R was developed by statisticians and data analysts as an interactive environment for data analysis. It is not like C or Java. R is free and Open source. Runs on all major platforms. Data objects and Scripts can be shared seamlessly across these platforms. R Console: for interactive commands, similar to the python interpreter. Installing R on Arch Linux : sudo pacman -Sy r Once R is installed, I was able to seamlesly use it in Org-babel, using the source &amp;lsquo;R&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Introduction The direct benefits of recording as much as you can The indirect benefits of recording as much as you can Some musings on handwritten notes Concluding points  
Introduction This is an outline of my thoughts on the benefits of maintaining a comprehensive record in your work life. While I&amp;rsquo;ve split my points into direct and indirect benefits of maintaining such a record - the distinguishment is much more an indication of the possibilities, rather than a strong demarcation.</description>

      <description>Whiplash is a fascinating movie on many levels regarding a topic that interests me deeply&amp;#x2026; How to progressively perform, and strive to become the very best in a chosen field. Personally, I found each step of the movie rivetting and would recommend it to anybody who would find the above question even mildly interesting. The movie&amp;rsquo;s climax was immensely interesting, inspiring and supported by great acting. At any rate, the movie induced a blog post&amp;#x2026;</description>
