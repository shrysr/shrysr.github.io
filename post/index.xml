      <description>Introduction Code School is kind enough to occasionally offer a free weekend with full access to their normally paid courses. I was able to capitalize on two such occasions to complete several courses. Below are the notes that were captured, directly into org-mode in emacs. The code builds on examples and lessons available on the Code School courses.
 Code School: I&amp;rsquo;ve completed courses on Python, Git, Regular Expressions and SQL.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is an outline of my thoughts on the benefits of maintaining a comprehensive record in your work life. While I&amp;rsquo;ve split my points into direct and indirect benefits of maintaining such a record - the distinguishment is much more an indication of the possibilities, rather than a strong demarcation.
I recall that a lot of kids used to take notes in school. Subsequently, I saw a lesser percentage of note-taking activities in college, mostly restricted to the high scoring sincere guys in the first few rows.</description>

      <description>Whiplash is a fascinating movie on many levels regarding a topic that interests me deeply&amp;#x2026; How to progressively perform, and strive to become the very best in a chosen field. Personally, I found each step of the movie rivetting and would recommend it to anybody who would find the above question even mildly interesting. The movie&amp;rsquo;s climax was immensely interesting, inspiring and supported by great acting. At any rate, the movie induced a blog post&amp;#x2026;</description>

      <description>R was developed by statisticians and data analysts as an interactive environment for data analysis. It is not like C or Java.
 R is free and Open source. Runs on all major platforms. Data objects and Scripts can be shared seamlessly across these platforms.
 R Console: for interactive commands, similar to the python interpreter.
 Installing R on Arch Linux : sudo pacman -Sy r
 Once R is installed, I was able to seamlesly use it in Org-babel, using the source &amp;lsquo;R&amp;rsquo;.</description>
