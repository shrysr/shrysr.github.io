Before my foray into Emacs, I purchased applications like IAWriter (classic)4, Marked2, Texts (cross platform Mac/Windows) and also tried all the recommended apps for longer form writing. I am a fan of zen writing apps.</description>

      <description>Whiplash: Wikipedia
Whiplash is a fascinating movie on many levels regarding a topic that interests me deeply&amp;#x2026; How to progressively perform, and strive to become the very best in a chosen field. Personally, I found each step of the movie riveting and would recommend it to anybody who would find the above question even mildly interesting. The movie&amp;rsquo;s climax was immensely interesting, inspiring and supported by great acting. At any rate, the movie induced a blog post&amp;#x2026;</description>
