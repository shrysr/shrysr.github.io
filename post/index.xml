      <description>Why use RSS? Off late, I had been relying more on email based content consumption. The phenomenally fast search and filtering capabilities that can be leveraged with mu4e make this easy.
However, even with all these filters, it is quite difficult to keep on top of news from different sources. At times it is inconvenient to mix important emails and correspondence with newsletters and the like, which arrive by the dozen(s) everyday.</description>

      <description>Discovered the glorious awesome lists today on Github. They are available through a simple search on github, and contain curated lists of resources of all kinds on a multitude of topics.
As one might expect, there is a lot of common ground between these lists, including topics and links.
How could one search for a keyword through all these repositories? I have always wanted search for particular keywords or code snippets in my Emacs configuration files, or in other files in a particular location.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a well known trick that installing a SSD in place of the conventional Hard disk can breathe new life into very old machines. My mid 2010 Macbook Pro is one such example, being over 8 years old. 1 , 2 , 3. really pretty obvious.
Before my foray into Emacs, I purchased applications like IAWriter (classic)4, Marked2, Texts (cross platform Mac/Windows), and have also tried almost all the recommended apps for longer form writing.</description>

      <description>Whiplash: Wikipedia
Whiplash is a fascinating movie on many levels regarding a topic that interests me deeply&amp;#x2026; How to progressively perform, and strive to become the very best in a chosen field. Personally, I found each step of the movie riveting and would recommend it to anybody who would find the above question even mildly interesting. The movie&amp;rsquo;s climax was immensely interesting, inspiring and supported by great acting. At any rate, the movie induced a blog post&amp;#x2026;</description>
