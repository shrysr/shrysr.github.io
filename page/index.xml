      <description>IRC @ Freenode: nick: shrysr
I&amp;rsquo;ll respond to your messages on IRC sometime or the other. I&amp;rsquo;m basically logged in via Weechat on a tmux server, which runs on a Linux host on Linode. I use a terminal to SSH into the server. Gosh, that&amp;rsquo;s a mouthful &amp;lsquo;innit?
Check out Kiwi IRC, a browser based IRC client. This link will connect you to Freenode: https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.freenode.net
Currently, I hang around the following channels #ossasepia #emacs #trilema #gnupg #docker #org-mode.</description>
