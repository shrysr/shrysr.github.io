      <description>Completed several courses covering python, git, SQL,regular expressions. Most of these courses were completed during the occasional Free Weekend opportunities from Code School, where the paid courses are available to be completed at no cost, for an entire weekend.&amp;rdquo;
 My Code School Report  is no longer available, since Pluralsight seem to be revamping these courses. However, these were great introductory courses.  </description>
