      <description>I came upon the glorious awesome lists today on Github. These repositories can be viewed with a simple search on github. They contain all kinds of lists on all kinds of topics, and are curated.
Beware! the number of lists and the number of items being covered are quite extensive. There are a lot of common grounds and topics between these lists.
I wanted to search for a keyword through all these repositories.</description>

Before my foray into Emacs, I purchased applications like IAWriter (classic), Marked2, Texts (cross platform Mac/Windows) and also tried several other free apps for longer form writing.</description>
