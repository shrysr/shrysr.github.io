      <description>The primary power of Emacs is that you can create customised workflows to suit your needs. However, lisp is probably not a language that many learn as a typical requirement in the academic systems, perhaps even for a software engineer.
How would one then start customisting Emacs? One way would be to hunt for snippets from forums like reddit and stack overflow, and customise them.
Another easy way to learn a programming language, especially one that is intrinsic to a software is to record macros and edit these macros.</description>
