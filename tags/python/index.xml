      <description>It is possible (and prevalent) to create templates to post process CFD Simulation results in ANSYS CFD Post using session (.cse) files. Using Shell scripts, it would then be simple to apply these session files on multiple result files and extract the output dictated by the session file.
This python script that enables the user to set the location of: - the session file (.cse) - the CFD result files (.</description>

This is a Python script for a portable, scalable job scheduler with multiple priorities - for ANSYS CFX simulations. The script was designed to be called every minute by an external scheduler program.
 In the practical case, the free version of the software System Scheduler was used to deploy the script successfully, for over 3 years, managing 2 computing clusters.</description>

      <description>Completed several courses covering python, git, SQL,regular expressions. Most of these courses were completed during the occasional Free Weekend opportunities from Code School, where the paid courses are available to be completed at no cost, for an entire weekend.&amp;rdquo;
 My Code School Report  is no longer available, since Pluralsight seem to be revamping these courses. However, these were great introductory courses.  </description>
