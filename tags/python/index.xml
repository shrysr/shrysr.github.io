      <description>Introduction Code School is kind enough to occasionally offer a free weekend with full access to their normally paid courses. I was able to capitalize on two such occasions to complete several courses. Below are the notes that were captured, directly into org-mode in emacs. The code builds on examples and lessons available on the Code School courses.
 Code School: I&amp;rsquo;ve completed courses on Python, Git, Regular Expressions and SQL.</description>

      <description>It is possible (and prevalent) to create templates to post process CFD Simulation results in ANSYS CFD Post using session (.cse) files. Using Shell scripts, it would then be simple to apply these session files on multiple result files and extract the output dictated by the session file.
This python script that enables the user to set the location of: - the session file (.cse) - the CFD result files (.</description>

      <description>Scheduler Psuedo-Algorithm   Introduction Code On Github
This is a Python script for a portable, scalable job scheduler with multiple priorities - for ANSYS CFX simulations. The script was designed to be called every minute by an external scheduler program.
 In the practical case, the free version of the software System Scheduler was used to deploy the script successfully, for over 3 years, managing 2 computing clusters.</description>
