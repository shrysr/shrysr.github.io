      <description>Why use RSS? Off late, I had been relying more on email based content consumption. The phenomenally fast search and filtering capabilities that can be leveraged with mu4e make this easy.
However, even with all these filters, it is quite difficult to keep on top of news from different sources. At times it is inconvenient to mix important emails and correspondence with newsletters and the like, which arrive by the dozen(s) everyday.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a well known trick that installing a SSD in place of the conventional Hard disk can breathe new life into very old machines. My mid 2010 Macbook Pro is one such example, being over 8 years old. 1 , 2 , 3. really pretty obvious.
Before my foray into Emacs, I purchased applications like IAWriter (classic)4, Marked2, Texts (cross platform Mac/Windows), and have also tried almost all the recommended apps for longer form writing.</description>
