      <description>Summary This is a short exploration into the tidy tuesday dataset focused on the Federal R&amp;amp;D budget towards global climate change. The data has been extracted from a TidyTuesday dataset, which in return is moderately cleaned dataset from publicly available data. The analysis will show that NASA&amp;rsquo;s budget dwarfs the money going into other departments, and that the median spend towards climate change has been increasing since the year 2000.</description>
