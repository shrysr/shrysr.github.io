      <description>I started out as a organised person who liked neat handwriting, extensive notes and a systematic approach to doing things.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of years that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using mu4e as my primary driver for dealing with email. Though I do on occasion rely on the web based interface, using mu4e has enabled me to master my email, like no other tool that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used. Before using mu4e, and the fastmail setup, I never really had any grip of my email inbox and could never leverage and utilise the wealth of data that lurks in each corner.</description>
