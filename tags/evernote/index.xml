      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used Evernote since 2014, with over 3k notes of all kinds stored in it. Though I did try to capture everything of interest - the procedure was never fast or streamlined enough for me. The Evernote app runs ridiculously slower on older phones. In particular, being used to the speed of Emacs and Org-mode - I was mostly displeased with the Evernote Mac / Windows apps as well. I ended up using the drafts app for writing on iOS devices.</description>
