      <title>An SSD can breathe life into old computers</title>
      <link>https://shrysr.github.io/post/01252410-853f-4570-858f-f3d609f5def5/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://shrysr.github.io/post/01252410-853f-4570-858f-f3d609f5def5/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a well known trick that installing a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.storagereview.com/ssd_vs_hdd&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SSD&lt;/a&gt; in place of the
conventional Hard disk can breathe new life into very old machines. My
mid 2010 Macbook Pro is one such example, being over 8 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, within Emacs - &lt;code&gt;mu4e&lt;/code&gt; responds much more quickly and there is
significantly less lag in searching / accessing emails and &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt; rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other advantage of using a Mac over Linux is that installation and
setup instructions are more often available out the box for the Mac OS
(though this is changing). I have access to dedicated apps including
Evernote, Dash, Spotify, Whatsap, Slack etc on my Mac. This is in
addition to several other high quality apps on the App store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do love using Arch Linux and Antergos and the packing management and
rolling OS upgrades are totally cool. However, a little bit of
elegance in the user interface and hardware (being available out of
the box) does ease up the mind and progress. It takes quite a bit of
effort to achieve that unless you are at the level of purely using
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/new-window-manager.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Emacs as window manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Mac, it is easy to move around virtual desktops and use the
magic track pad to rapidly switch between applications as well. I&amp;rsquo;m
sure many of these &amp;lsquo;gimmicks&amp;rsquo; may be setup with diligence and due time
on Linux through solutions with varying levels of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as of today : it&amp;rsquo;s likely I would have struggled with some
aspects on Linux that are readily available on other systems. Evernote
is an example. After hours of searching for an alternate (and
acceptable) solution for software packages that are not yet ported to
Linux, I would quite possibly end up making a compromise. Typically,
the compromises would mean using Electron or Web based versions of
apps, which are often not as powerful as the desktop app, not to
mention inconvenient. A prime example would be Evernote, on Arch
Linux. Some other examples are apps like Word, Pages, Outlook and Excel and
so on, which are more critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my preference would be to use a Mac as my daily driver and
play around with Linux on a back up computer. In any case, multiple
Linux distros can be run on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.virtualbox.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Virtual Box&lt;/a&gt; within the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Switching from Evernote to DEVONtechnologies products</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;a href=&#34;https://evernote.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; since 2014, with over 3k notes of all kinds stored
in it. Though I did try to capture everything of interest - the
procedure was never fast or streamlined enough for me. The Evernote
app runs ridiculously slower on older phones. In particular, being
used to the speed of Emacs and Org-mode - I was mostly displeased with
the Evernote Mac / Windows apps as well. I ended up using the drafts
app for writing on iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, using Evernote was still worth due to the availability of an
excellent catch-all bucket for multiple kinds of information, that can
be searched on demand. I could literally whip up important receipts or
scanned copies of a document and it felt wonderful to have that kind
of control over your information. This foray was also fueled by the
deficiencies of Emacs in mobile apps and the ability to store and
refer to rich content and several file types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;switching-to-devonthink-pro-dtp&#34;&gt;Switching to DEVONthink Pro (DTP)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently converted to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DEVONthink Pro&lt;/a&gt; (DTP). Though DTP is Mac /
iOS only, I would personally prefer DTP over Evernote. Some advantages
of DTP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blazing fast application response + search on both iOS and Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leverages AI to provide interesting connections between notes and
ideas. Users have leveraged these connections to help generate new
ideas from unforeseen connections. There&amp;rsquo;s more information &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devontechnologies.com/technology.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so far, my experience is that the notes have to be in a particular
format,I.e one article or principal idea per note to enable a
sensible matching with other relevant articles. There are several
incorrect connections also made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better control over content organisation.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project and folder creation, including separate databases for
different kinds of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One time payment for a major version of the software, along with
discounted upgrades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to index local folders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using multiple &amp;lsquo;databases&amp;rsquo; customised to any workflow, along with
the provision of password protection and syncing to multiple sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ability to confidently store private information based on the
encryption and custom syncing options available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to store web archives of Linked in posts (or any
content). This was not always possible with Evernote. The iOS share
option of clipping to the DEVONthink to go app as a web archive
works rather well most of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Evernote plug-in for Chrome/ Firefox works relatively slower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connection with DEVONAgent Pro (a fascinating tool dedicated to
customised and deep web search. More on this on another blog post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy scripts on databases / notes and thus allowing custom
workflows with particular note categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DTP can import all your Evernote notes and tags as they are. This
worked for me in a single attempt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s actually hard to quantify the benefits of using DTP. There are a
myriad of features within, including the ability to index locations
and script automated workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the part, I found the speed and response of Evernote to be
frustrating. It hindered a streamlined workflow. There are also
additional irritations with respect to the .enex format and being able
to encrypt information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt, the ubiquity of Evernote in almost all the platforms (except
Linux&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fnr.1&#34; class=&#34;footref&#34; href=&#34;#fn.1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) works in its favor. However, the search response with DTP
is incredibly rapid and the note viewing experience of DTP is
extremely smooth. This is on an ancient mid 2010 macbook pro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also worth noting that unlike Evernote - I was actually intrigued
enough to correspond with the technical support team of DTP to
understand features like indexing a folder, and their responses have
been prompt and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best place to find up to date information is on the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.devontechnologies.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DEVONtechnologies forum&lt;/a&gt;. Even a deep search on the internet does not
lead to many articles about the DEVONthink technologies products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-caveats-of-dtp&#34;&gt;Some caveats of DTP&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DTP does offer all the flexibility above. However the quality of the
Evernote webclipper&amp;rsquo;s output is better in several cases. The
uncluttered text grab is not automated well enough. I&amp;rsquo;m yet to
discover the best pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several apps offer Evernote integration as a premium feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evernote offers a more &amp;lsquo;polished&amp;rsquo; and simpler interface and is
mainstream and available on multiple platforms. The note taking
editors and capture mechanism is more user friendly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;devonagent-pro-dap&#34;&gt;DEVONagent Pro (DAP)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAP is an intriguing bit of software that facilitates deep searches of
the web and developing automated workflows including report
development. Their algorithm filters searches from any number of
databases / engines / websites to provide the best matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could use this to monitor the website of a competitor for news
announcements. Or crawl Hackernews for the keyword Datascience. It
appears to be a tool that can provide exactly the information that we
seek by processing the information out there in the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes generation of mind-map esque graphs connecting keywords
in all the search results. I&amp;rsquo;m yet to explore more, but it is very
interesting so far, especially to gain an overview of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-conclusions&#34;&gt;Some Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring DTP in conjunction with DEVONagent Pro is absolutely a
worthwhile exercise for those relying a lot on information from the
internet for their jobs and work, and those working in an apple
eco-system. It has a steep(er) learning curve, but will transform your
information management. DAP is also a worthy option to explore to deep
search the web on focused topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is mac only software. I have not been able to find any
equivalent apps on windows. Another reason to stick to the
Apple-verse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is addictive and once a good workflow has been built up, it
would be difficult to use anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;archiving-interesting-linked-in-posts&#34;&gt;Archiving interesting Linked in posts:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most killer features of using the DEVON 2 GO app is the
ability to capture Linked in posts as web archives. Though not
optimal, in terms of the format - it is still extremely useful to
rapidly build up a reference database of web resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fn.1&#34; href=&#34;#fnr.1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Nixnote is one solution. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it in action and it is
useful, and probably even closer to DEVONthink. However, I could never
get it working in Arch Linux reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back to RSS</title>
      <link>https://shrysr.github.io/post/c641a230-37c9-46aa-84eb-e78cc00d0c7e/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://shrysr.github.io/post/c641a230-37c9-46aa-84eb-e78cc00d0c7e/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-use-rss&#34;&gt;Why use RSS?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off late, I had been relying more on email based content consumption. The phenomenally fast search and filtering capabilities that can be leveraged with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mu4e&lt;/a&gt; make this easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even with all these filters, it is quite difficult to keep on top of news from different sources. At times it is inconvenient to mix important emails and correspondence with newsletters and the like, which arrive by the dozen(s) everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a nagging feeling that relevant and &amp;lsquo;up to date&amp;rsquo; information is better searched through Google, with a fresh search each time. However, this approach invites distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above made me realise that a dedicated &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; reader could inspire focused reading and aid in retention of information, and could be a better option than flooding my inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An all-in-one solution for reading RSS feeds with a capable in-built browser to view images/webpages/videos would be excellent, along with the ability to sync with multiple services and facilitate capturing notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;exploration&#34;&gt;Exploration:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within Emacs - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Elfeed&lt;/a&gt; (along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/algernon/elfeed-goodies&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Elfeed-goodies&lt;/a&gt;) is a good option to read feeds and is strongly integrated with Emacs and org-mode. A single keypress can be programmed to store a link as a note. Unfortunately, (perhaps due to my age old machine) activating elfeed makes Emacs lag to the extent of being useless. An alternative was necessary for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: As I set up all the feeds on Planet Emacsen, I felt a profound happiness in being able to selectively glance at and process a lot of information quickly and was also able to implement a few configuration tricks found through the feeds. On the contrary, with email - I&amp;rsquo;ve felt somewhat overwhelmed. This prompted me to explore further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it does not seem to be a mainstream recommendation on reviews like &lt;a href=&#34;https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-rss-reader-os-x/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the sweet setup&lt;/a&gt; : &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vienna-rss.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; is a reliable solution (open source!) to consider using to browse RSS feeds on the Mac OS. This comes with a caveat - some tinkering is required to get it to sync with a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vienna has inbuilt share options to share via Buffer or Twitter. Side note: I would recommend using &lt;a href=&#34;https://buffer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; to manage posts on multiple social media sites in a seamless manner. Buffer&amp;rsquo;s free tier should be sufficient for moderate, personal purposes. I use it to post on Twitter and Linked in simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;harvesting-information&#34;&gt;Harvesting information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next consideration was harvesting information of interest from the RSS feeds. If not Emacs, the information has to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DEVONThink Pro&lt;/a&gt; (DTP), which has a handy pull out drawer into which content can be dragged. I was able to just drag and drop the article or text selection into the DTP drawer. This appears as a URL / bookmark in DTP, and can be converted to a formatted note or web archive subsequently. A script could probably accomplish this automatically. That&amp;rsquo;s for a future project.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://shrysr.github.io/img/vienna-dtp-drawer.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Screenshot - Vienna &amp;#43; DTP drawer&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Granted, an application external to Emacs (especially without a customisable keyboard driven flow) is not the desirable way to do things. Most websites usually have an RSS feed or email subscription possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;opting-for-feedly-as-a-susbcription-service-and-rss-app&#34;&gt;Opting for Feedly as a susbcription service and RSS app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next step, Vienna had to be abandoned as it felt more sensible to opt for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://feedly.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; subscription (in order to get going quickly with syncing across devices). The Feedly app turned out to run surprisingly well on my ancient iPad and I can still drag and drop entire articles into DTP which come out to be formatted RTFD files which could be read and highlighted in leisure. While it may be nice to opt for a standalone app in the Mac for RSS feeds, the Feedly app satisfies my needs and is also available cross-platform. Note: I use the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unread app&lt;/a&gt; to read RSS on my newer iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the numerous sync options, &lt;a href=&#34;https://feedly.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; provides other interesting features in their pro subscription, like setting up Google keyword searching and organising multiple feeds into &amp;lsquo;boards&amp;rsquo;. This will certainly help in enabling some level of filtering. The method of organising sources and opml imports in the mac app is a little clunky and not that intuitive, but it is usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-cover-them-all&#34;&gt;How to cover them all?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With numerous sources available on most topics - a technique to read is of even more importance. Besides leveraging custom boards, it seems the best way to consume content is to rapidly sweep through the titles and the short descriptions, and in parallel skim through articles of interest. If the article (even slightly) feels worth recording and reading in detail, I select the entire article and drag it into DTP via the drawer for a future session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to deploy DTP as my primary reading app, because of the ability to highlight lines (which are generally available across devices). Besides aiding in skimming the article in the future, it helps me know I&amp;rsquo;ve actually read the article. This is in addition to the core ability to use DTP&amp;rsquo;s AI algorithms in searching through my notes and forming connections between ideas. I also use smart groups that show me the articles captured in the last 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, which helps me re-visit them in a structured method. The latter works rather well as a memory aid.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://shrysr.github.io/img/feedly-dtp-screenshot.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Article captured from Feedly into DTP&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;future-plans&#34;&gt;Future plans?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be ideal to setup my own server which will process the RSS feeds. Perhaps a Raspberry Pi or something else could be employed. This would be a cost efficient approach for the long term. The DEVONAgent Pro app could be leveraged for deep searches. Web scraping could be performed regularly from a set of links for deeper insight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Searching the awesome-lists on github</title>
      <link>https://shrysr.github.io/post/03133c10-709e-4d06-9f3d-c00ffeae64a7/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://shrysr.github.io/post/03133c10-709e-4d06-9f3d-c00ffeae64a7/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Discovered the glorious awesome lists today on Github. They are
available through a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/search?utf8=%25E2%259C%2593&amp;amp;q=awesome+list&amp;amp;type=&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;simple search on github&lt;/a&gt;, and contain curated
lists of resources of all kinds on a multitude of topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one might expect, there is a lot of common ground between these lists,
including topics and links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could one search for a keyword through all these repositories?  I
have always wanted search for particular keywords or code snippets in
my Emacs configuration files, or in other files in a particular
location. This is especially to verify if a bit of code or note is
already available, in another location. Something that looks like this ;):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://shrysr.github.io/img/emacs-helm-ag-anim.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Searching for &amp;#39;datascience&amp;#39; with emacs-helm-ag through a bunch of awesome-lists and other local repositories.&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An answer had been available in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/why-emacs.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Howard&amp;rsquo;s cool blog post&lt;/a&gt; on why one
should learn Emacs - in a footnote (!), in which he&amp;rsquo;s mentioned &lt;code&gt;ack&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;ag&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the silver searcher&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fnr.1&#34; class=&#34;footref&#34; href=&#34;#fn.1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is even possible to
edit in line with each search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silver searcher github page provides clear examples of how it&amp;rsquo;s
significantly faster than ack (and similar). Further exploration led
me to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;emacs-helm-ag&lt;/a&gt; package, which is a helm interface to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the
silver searcher&lt;/a&gt;. Implementing emacs-helm-ag was as simple as adding it
to my list of packages, and adding a basic setup to my helm
configuration.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fnr.2&#34; class=&#34;footref&#34; href=&#34;#fn.2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweet !!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://shrysr.github.io/img/helm-ag-emacs.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Notice the search across multiple files. So I&amp;#39;ve called `require org capture` perhaps more times than necessary.&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

      <title>Iosevka - an awesome font for Emacs</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Before my foray into Emacs, I purchased applications like &lt;a href=&#34;https://ia.net/writer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IAWriter&lt;/a&gt;
(classic)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fnr.1&#34; class=&#34;footref&#34; href=&#34;#fn.1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://brettterpstra.com/2017/08/01/long-form-writing-with-marked-2-plus-2-dot-5-11-teaser/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Marked2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.texts.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Texts&lt;/a&gt; (cross platform Mac/Windows), and have
also tried almost all the recommended apps for longer form writing. I
am a fan of zen writing apps. In particular the font and environment
provided by IAWriter are conducive to focused writing. There also
exist apps like Hemingway that also help check the quality of your
writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zen writing apps are called so because they have a unique combination
of fonts, background color, including line spacing and overall
text-width - all of which enable a streamlined and focused flow of
words onto the screen. Any customisation required towards this end is
possible in Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texts app has some nifty features (besides being cross platform),
but the font and appearance is not as beautiful as IAWriter. Both
IAWriter (classic) and Texts have minimal settings for further
customisation. See the comparison below:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://shrysr.github.io/img/emacs-texts.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Emacs (writeroom-mode &amp;#43; Iosevka font) || Texts (Sepia theme)&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://shrysr.github.io/img/emacs-iawriter.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Emacs (writeroom-mode, Iosevka font) || IAWriter(Classic)&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While everybody&amp;rsquo;s style and approach vary, there are many authors who
swear by archaic text editors and tools that enable distraction free
writing. One example is &lt;a href=&#34;http://tonyballantyne.com/how-to-write/writing-tools/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tony Ballantyne&amp;rsquo;s post on writing tools&lt;/a&gt;,
and several more examples are available in this &lt;a href=&#34;http://irreal.org/blog/?p=4651&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next best thing to a clear retina display on a MacBook Pro, is a
beautiful font face to take you through the day, enhancing the viewing
pleasure and thus the motivation to work longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Emacs, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;writeroom-mode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fnr.2&#34; class=&#34;footref&#34; href=&#34;#fn.2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Emacs can be customised to
mimic IAWriter. In this regard, the font &lt;a href=&#34;https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Iosevka&lt;/a&gt;, is a great font to
try. This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/5twcka/which_font_do_you_use/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;old Emacs reddit&lt;/a&gt; has many more suggestions. One post
described Iosevka as &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;it&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like much, but after a few hours
it will be difficult to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;use any other font.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; This is exactly what
happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fn.1&#34; href=&#34;#fnr.1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The latest version of IAWriter has a truck load of features and
advantages over over the Classic version. I did consider purchasing
it, but Emacs won the day. Nevertheless, as a plain vanilla writing
app - IAWriter offers much right out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fn.2&#34; href=&#34;#fnr.2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of tweaking to be done with &lt;code&gt;writeroom-mode&lt;/code&gt;,
but this is certainly a workable result. My nascent configuration for
writeroom-mode in emacs is as follows (munged off the internet!). It&amp;rsquo;s remarkable how much was
achieved with a few lines of code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(with-eval-after-load &#39;writeroom-mode
  (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd &amp;quot;C-s-,&amp;quot;) #&#39;writeroom-decrease-width)
  (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd &amp;quot;C-s-.&amp;quot;) #&#39;writeroom-increase-width)
  (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd &amp;quot;C-s-=&amp;quot;) #&#39;writeroom-adjust-width))

(advice-add &#39;text-scale-adjust :after
        #&#39;visual-fill-column-adjust)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Notes from the movie Whiplash</title>
      <link>https://shrysr.github.io/post/5fc69e19-e330-4dd9-9317-7280a9c93966/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash_%25282014_film%2529&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Whiplash: Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whiplash is a fascinating movie on many levels regarding a topic that interests me deeply&amp;#x2026; How to progressively perform, and strive to become the very best in a chosen field. Personally, I found each step of the movie riveting and would recommend it to anybody who would find the above question even mildly interesting. The movie&amp;rsquo;s climax  was immensely interesting, inspiring and supported by great acting.  At any rate, the movie induced a blog post&amp;#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story revolves around the mind and life of a student who wants to be among the greats in his field, and the way he deals with an abrasive, abusive and unorthodox teacher whose intentions are to bring out the best in a student. No movie is perfect - while some points in Whiplash do appear extreme and therefore relatively unrealistic - the overriding message and theme conveyed certainly rings out clearly, in an engaging plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could relate to the following pointers from the movie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;leverage-stress-to-achieve-new-levels-of-insight-and-performance&#34;&gt;Leverage stress to achieve new levels of insight and performance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The belief of the teacher, that the best performance or attributes hidden inside a person can come out only via repeated, unexpected and  stressful prodding. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this works as shown in the movie, but I have found unexpected insights at times of extreme stress, that have been taken forward to habits that changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;weathering-criticism&#34;&gt;Weathering criticism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mental conditioning required to weather and beat intense, sharp,
depressing criticism along with verbal and physical abuse from a
mentor or teacher and use the same as a motive force for
self-improvement and eventually superlative performance. Though there
are examples of extreme abrasiveness in leaders like Steve Jobs - such
an approach would not be tolerated by most people today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know other stories of people working under such mentors,
striving to learn and gain their approval and eventually winning
the same. These efforts paid off by resulting in skills, thinking
patterns and a superior mental conditioning. Finding such a mentor
at the formative stage is probably the best thing to happen to
anybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An effective strategy to find mentors is to shadow people on Linked in and learn from their profiles and activity. Some of them may be willing to connect and invest time in mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility to find like minded people and mentors would be to join the communities of on-line courses, like Datacamp and Dataquest, who have lively channels in Slack for paid members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;getting-back-up-after-a-fall&#34;&gt;Getting back up after a fall&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody breaks. Just as the promising student in Whiplash
breaks. But the champions among us rally, to stage a comeback and
performance that make history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regularly surpassing the level of deliberate knowledge of your own performance, and thus improvement by exactly being able to measure your performance and pinpoint mistakes. This point is portrayed in a very interesting manner in Whiplash, where the teacher expects the student to know exactly what mistake is being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;be-great-not-good&#34;&gt;Be Great, not Good&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejecting the &amp;lsquo;Good&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Good enough&amp;rsquo; feedback from anybody. The goal is to be &lt;em&gt;Great&lt;/em&gt;, not good. The goal should be to strive to set the precedent and not just follow a beaten track. The pinpoint focus should be on progressive improvement to become the best, and that entails never being satisfied and to be ruthless in rooting out flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;achieving-balance-mind-body-surroundings&#34;&gt;Achieving Balance : mind + body + surroundings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great performance is about that perfect balance between the body, mind and environment to leverage the best result possible. I view the scene where the student survives a car crash, just to reach a performance and then not being able to perform, as a good example of overreaching, without strengthening the core, and thus inviting instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;go-off-the-beaten-track-and-lose-yourself&#34;&gt;Go off the beaten track and Lose yourself&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the ending of Whiplash that truly drove me to comprehend the points so far. It is twisted, quite unexpected and led me to truly enjoy the movie and appreciate that: despite the above points being reasonably discernible - the human mind and nature is exceedingly complex. Stability and reasoning are not the only keystones to the foundation of greatness. There has to be a &lt;em&gt;healthy&lt;/em&gt; mix of some form of abnormal obsession thrown in, to make a stellar performance what it is. However, can this be practically repeated on a regular basis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-velocity-and-flow&#34;&gt;Learning velocity and Flow&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several bodies of research work available today that can be studied to get closer to consciously stimulating a great performance. One such example is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/unlocking-the-talent-code-with-dan-coyle&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unlocking the Talent Code With Dan Coyle&lt;/a&gt; on the Unmistakable
Creatives podcast provides an insight in line with the points seen
above, into what constitute outliers and performers. The interesting
concept of &amp;lsquo;Learning velocity&amp;rsquo; is explained by Dan with a lucid
example. It is surmised that progress and maximum learning to become
better occurs &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; the boundary line dividing what we know at the
moment, and the unknown skills that beckon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That point sems to be an amalgamation of several factors, that are typically present when someone is in &amp;lsquo;flow&amp;rsquo;. Perhaps this flow can be described as a heightened sense of what is, and what should be and the energy to strive and achieve what should be.. It certainly does feel logical to think that we become better by pushing that boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible (and prevalent) to create templates to post process CFD Simulation results in ANSYS CFD Post using session (.cse) files. Using Shell scripts, it would then be simple to apply these session files on multiple result files and extract the output dictated by the session file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This python script that enables the user to set the location of:
- the session file (.cse)
- the CFD result files (.res)
- create a BAT script with sequential lines, each calling ANSYS CFD Post with the necessary arguments
- run the session script on all the result files available in a particular location.
- gracefully exit, removing all the temporary script files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shrysr/cfdpost_auto&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Code On Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-it-helped&#34;&gt;How it helped&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While these operations could be done directly in python, it is
easier and simpler to control ANSYS CFD post using a BASH
script. Therefore the python program creates a BASH script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

# Description: 
# This is a simple program that is designed to apply am ANSYS CFD post macro on all the results available at a particular location, one after the other. There are 3 strings required to be set as input by the user.
# 1. The location of the ANSYS CFD Post executable
# 2. THe path to the macro file (.cst/.cse)
# 3. The folder location where the result files are located.

# Note : the &amp;gt;quit command can be written in the post macro to optionally execute the post macro on one file after the other automatically. Otherwise CFD Post has to be quit manually by the user after the macro is applied on each file.

###---------- USER INPUT -------------###
# Setting the paths to various locations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View : &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/What_is_Open_Source%3F&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CFD-Online Wiki page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my initial foray into open source CFD and especially getting
started with Linux - there was a lot of information that I had to
collate from different sources in order to figure out each step. In
addition, there were perspectives on performance that could be gained
only through experience. Therefore, I plugged back the knowledge
gained to the CFD-Online wiki with the idea that it would help any
newbie get started a little quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, the number of courses and the material
available on-line on CFD, Linux and applying Numerical techniques has
increased substantially. This is somewhat supported by the increasing
trend of page views &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cfd-online.com/About/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shown on the CFD-Online
Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, this document
still serves as a useful overview and getting started guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation explores the idea of Open Source software, and the
basic techniques to get started with the exploration. Eg: the
different options of running Linux on your current machine as well as
the pros and cons of each approach, and the software options
available, as well as links to useful and high quality information and
tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shrysr/jobscheduler&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Code On Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shrysr.github.io/jobscheduler/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shrysr/jobscheduler/wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wiki on Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Python script for a portable, scalable job scheduler with
multiple priorities - for ANSYS CFX simulations. The script was
designed to be called every minute by an external scheduler
program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the practical case, the free version of the software
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.splinterware.com/products/scheduler.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;System
Scheduler&lt;/a&gt; was
used to deploy the script successfully, for over 3 years, managing 2
computing clusters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once called, the program basically loops through pre designated
folders and lists .def files based on the &lt;em&gt;last modified&lt;/em&gt; date
available in Windows. The system interaction is via BASH scripts
created via the Python code, as well as the python OS library. There
are several in-built flags to support priority, pausing a particular
cluster, logging data and troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the project was to create a multi-platform job
scheduler for ANSYS CFX that has a balance between sophistication and
ease of deployment (and management). Typically job schedulers and load
balancing programs are relatively very sophisticated and complex to
setup with several pre-requisites and constraints. Such complexity
dictates expensive commercial support and licensing considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem-statement&#34;&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A job scheduler or simulation management system was required to address the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimum and continuous simulation solver license utilisation by all
members of the team in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provision for dynamic or urgent priority jobs, as well as an
interface to submit simulations or view job history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimisation and management of workload of simulation jobs
facilitating overall project management and planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-the-program-accomplished&#34;&gt;What the program accomplished&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowed users to submit simulations by simply placing the input
files in a particular folder location, which also served as a
particular priority basket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed the need of creating manual scripts to submit multiple
simulations and resolved inefficient license utilisation approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitated a optimised approach to certain design cases, thus
resulting in a 75% reduction in simulation time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enabled the use of consistent solver and memory utilisation
parameters and settings, allowing efficient deployment and reducing
inefficiencies due to errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowed optimal or perfect utilisation of available licensing
scheme, resulting in a significant increase in team output and
productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tools-used-and-links&#34;&gt;Tools used and links&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written with Python 2.7, using portable python, Spyder, Notepad ++ and Sublime Text 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.splinterware.com/products/scheduler.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;System Scheduler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The course covered an introduction to using &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; to extract, manipulate and thus analyse data. It basically lays the foundations to using R in data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;verified-edx-certificate-of-achievement-https-courses-edx-org-certificates-0d3a83463cdb49c8aca2aa11ab9bd850&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://courses.edx.org/certificates/0d3a83463cdb49c8aca2aa11ab9bd850&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Verified EdX Certificate of Achievement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Course exercises are linked with a Datacamp course.

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
