      <title>Some notes on research-compendium</title>

      <description>These are my notes while studying the research-compendium concept, which is essentially a bunch of guidelines to produce research that is &amp;lsquo;easily&amp;rsquo; reproducible.
The notes are mostly based on marwick-2018-packag-r , which is one canonical reading on the concept. Other references are mentioned throughout the text, and also collected separately. These notes were prepared a few weeks ago during a foray into Docker. They are neither complete not comprehensive - but will serve as a good refresher of the principle concepts.</description>

      <title>Using ESS for Data Science</title>

      <description>RStudio is a formidable IDE to work with and offers an environment to seamlessly work with multiple languages beyond R. It is especially convenient for tasks involving frequent visualisation of data frames and plots, and for use with Shiny app development.
However, the text (i.e code) editing capabalities are still significantly lacking compared to the likes of Emacs and Vim. Besides this, it does not offer a seamless interface integrating task, time management and multi-language programming environments to the extent available within Org-mode via Emacs.</description>

      <title>Federal R&amp;D Spending on climate change</title>

      <description>Summary This is a short exploration into the tidy tuesday dataset focused on the Federal R&amp;amp;D budget towards global climate change. The data has been extracted from a TidyTuesday dataset, which in return is moderately cleaned dataset from publicly available data. The analysis will show that NASA&amp;rsquo;s budget dwarfs the money going into other departments, and that the median spend towards climate change has been increasing since the year 2000.</description>

      <description>Lubridate - introductory technical paper This paper (Grolemund and Wickham) offers a good introduction and comparison between using lubridate and not using it, as well as several examples of using the library. It also offers some case studies which can serve as useful drill exercises.
